# Ola Ride Performance Analysis
Tools Used: SQL | Power BI

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Ola ride booking data to evaluate platform performance, including booking success, cancellations, payment methods, vehicle-type usage, and customer ratings. The objective is to gain operational insights that support decision-making.

## What Was Done
- Analyzed ride data using SQL to answer operational and business questions
- Evaluated booking success rates, cancellations, and payment methods
- Studied vehicle-type performance and ride distance patterns
- Built a Power BI dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs)

## Key Analysis Areas
- Successful vs cancelled bookings
- Cancellation reasons by customers and drivers
- Revenue distribution by payment method
- Vehicle-type performance and ride distance
- Customer and driver ratings

## Key Insights
- Cash and UPI are the dominant payment methods
- Cancellations represent a major operational challenge
- Different vehicle types serve different ride-distance patterns
- Ratings are fairly consistent across vehicle types, indicating stable service quality

## Business Value
The analysis helps identify areas to reduce cancellations, optimize vehicle allocation, and focus on dominant payment channels to improve operational efficiency.
